/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5],
which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each,
his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Hint:
An easy approach is to sort the array first.
What are the possible values of h-index?
A faster approach is to use extra space.
